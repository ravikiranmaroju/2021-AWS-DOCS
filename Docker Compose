Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, 
you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, 
you create and start all the services from your configuration. ... 
Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire app

Docker Compose ─ Installation

Step 1 − Download the necessary files from github using the following command −
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.10.0-rc2/dockercompose
   -$(uname -s) -$(uname -m)" -o /home/demo/docker-compose

Step 2 − Next, we need to provide execute privileges to the downloaded Docker Compose file, using the following command −
chmod +x /home/demo/docker-compose

docker-compose version

vi docker-compose.yml 

version: '3'
services:
      web:
       image: nginx
       ports:
        - 9090:80/tcp

     database:
       image: redis


# docker-compose config > If no errors move to the creation comand that is up 

# docker-compose up 

When its up > ip:9090

or another example:

vi docker-compose.yml 

MYSQL with NGINX

version: '2'
services:
   databases:
     image: mysql
     ports:
     - "3306:3306"
     environment:
     - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSOWRD=password
     - MYSQL_USER=admin
     - MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
     - MYSQL_DATABASE=mysql
   web:
    image: nginx 

# docker-compose config > If no errors move to the creation comand that is up 

# docker-compose up 

# docker ps 

How to scale the containers —scale scale no. of serverices for a container
docker-compose up -d --scale database=4  ( here database is the service name given in yml file)
check with the cmd # docker ps

docker-compose down ( to kill the services)
