NAGIOS BASICS

Nagios /ˈnɑːɡiːoʊs/, now known as Nagios Core, is a free and open source computer-software application that monitors systems, networks and infrastructure. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. It alerts users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved.
Ethan Galstad and a group of developers originally wrote Nagios as NetSaint. As of 2015 they actively maintain both the official and unofficial plugins. Nagios is a recursive acronym: "Nagios Ain't Gonna Insist On Sainthood"[3] – "sainthood" makes reference to the original name NetSaint, which changed in response to a legal challenge by owners of a similar trademark.[4] "Agios" (or "hagios") also transliterates the Greek word άγιος, which means "saint".
Nagios was originally designed to run under Linux, but it also runs well on other Unix variants. It is free software licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.

NAGIOS INST & CONFIG On UBUNTU 
I have used the AMI ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20180912 (ami-059eeca93cf09eebd)

sudo -i

apt update

#Installing the prerequisites
sudo apt-get install wget build-essential apache2 php apache2-mod-php7.0 php-gd libgd-dev sendmail unzip

#User and group configuration
useradd nagios groupadd nagcmd usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios usermod -a -G nagios,nagcmd www-data

#Before Installing Nagios
cd ~ wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.2.0.tar.gz tar -xzf nagios*.tar.gz cd nagios-4.2.0

#Compile Nagios
./configure --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-command-group=nagcmd

#Now to install Nagios:
make all sudo make install sudo make install-commandmode sudo make install-init sudo make install-config /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 sample-config/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

#And copy evenhandler directory to the nagios directory:
cp -R contrib/eventhandlers/ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/ chown -R nagios:nagios /usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers

#Install the Nagios Plugins
cd ~ wget https://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.1.2.tar.gz tar -xzf nagios-plugins*.tar.gz cd nagios-plugins-2.1.2

#Install the Nagios plugin's with the commands below:
./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-openssl make make install

#Configure Nagios
vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
#uncomment line 50 or 51 for the host monitor configuration.
cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
Save and exit.


#Add a new folder named servers:
mkdir -p /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers


#Nagios Notification Configuration. If u need email notification do it if not skip it 
apt install postfix mailutils
nano /etc/postfix/main.cf 
inet_interfaces = localhost
systemctl restart postfix
systemctl restart nagios


#The Nagios contact can be configured in the contact.cfg file. To open it use:
vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg
#Then replace the default email with your own email.

#Configuring Apache
sudo a2enmod rewrite sudo a2enmod cgi

#You can use the htpasswd command to configure a user nagiosadmin for the nagios web interface
sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
#and type your new password and retype the password again

#enable the Nagios virtualhost
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/

#Start Apache and Nagios
service apache2 restart service nagios start

#When Nagios starts, you may see the following error : if so follow below steps if not avoid it 
#Starting nagios (via systemctl): nagios.serviceFailed

#And this is how to fix it:
cd /etc/init.d/ cp /etc/init.d/skeleton /etc/init.d/nagios

#Now edit the Nagios file:
vim /etc/init.d/nagios
#... and add the following code:

NAGIOS INST & CONFIG LINUX

Step 1: Install Prerequisite Software
Nagios requires the following packages are installed on your server prior to installing Nagios:

* Apache 
* PHP 
* GCC compiler 
* GD development libraries

You can use yum to install these packages by running the following commands (as ec2-user):

-> sudo yum update -y
-> sudo yum install httpd php -y
-> sudo yum install gcc glibc glibc-common -y
-> sudo yum install gd gd-devel -y

Step 2: Create Account Information
You need to setup a Nagios user. Run the following commands:

-> sudo adduser -m nagios 
-> sudo passwd nagios

Type the new password twice. Then create a new nagcmd group for allowing external commands to be submitted through the web interface:

-> sudo groupadd nagcmd 
-> sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios 
-> sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd apache

Step 3: Download Nagios Core and the Plugins
Expand
Create a directory for storing the downloads.

-> mkdir ~/downloads 
-> cd ~/downloads

Download the source code tarballs of both Nagios and the Nagios plugins (visit http://www.nagios.org/download/ for links to the latest versions). These directions were tested with Nagios Core 4.0.8 and Nagios Plugins 2.0.3.

-> wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagios/nagios-4.0.8.tar.gz 
-> wget http://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.0.3.tar.gz

Step 4: Compile and Install Nagios
Extract the Nagios source code tarball.

-> tar zxvf nagios-4.0.8.tar.gz 
-> cd nagios-4.0.8

Run the Nagios configure script, passing the name of the group you created earlier like so: 
-> ./configure --with-command-group=nagcmd

Compile the Nagios source code. 
-> make all

Install binaries, init script, sample config files and set permissions on the external command directory. 
-> sudo make install 
-> sudo make install-init 
-> sudo make install-config 
-> sudo make install-commandmode

Step 5: Customize Configuration
Sample configuration files have now been installed in the /usr/local/nagios/etc directory. These sample files should work fine for getting started with Nagios. You'll need to make just one change before you proceed...

Edit the /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg config file with your favorite editor and change the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact definition to the address you'd like to use for receiving alerts.

-> sudo vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

Step 6: Configure the Web Interface
Install the Nagios web config file in the Apache conf.d directory.

-> sudo make install-webconf

Create a nagiosadmin account for logging into the Nagios web interface. Remember the password you assign to this account - you'll need it later. 
-> sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Type the new password twice. Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect. 
-> sudo service httpd restart

Step 7: Compile and Install the Nagios Plugins
Extract the Nagios plugins source code tarball.

-> cd ~/downloads 
-> tar zxvf nagios-plugins-2.0.3.tar.gz 
-> cd nagios-plugins-2.0.3

Compile and install the plugins.

-> ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios 
-> make 
-> sudo make install

Step 8: Start Nagios
Add Nagios to the list of system services and have it automatically start when the system boots.

-> sudo chkconfig --add nagios 
-> sudo chkconfig nagios on

Verify the sample Nagios configuration files.

-> sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

If there are no errors, start Nagios.

-> sudo service nagios start

Step 9: Update AWS Security Group
Expand
Assuming you havn't already done so you need to open port 80 on the new server to incoming traffic so you can connect to the new Nagios webpage.

* From the EC2 console select Security Groups from the left navigation pane. 
* Select the Security Group applicable for the instance that Nagios was installed on and open the Inbound tab 
* If there is no rule to allow HTTP traffic on port 80 then click edit in the Inbound tab to add a new rule 
* Click on New Rule button 
* Scroll down to select HTTP from the list under Type 
* If you want to be able to access nagios from anywhere then select Save, otherwise enter the IP address or range of IP address you want to be able to access it from then select Save.

Step 10: Login to the Web Interface
Expand
You should now be able to access the Nagios web interface to do this you will need to know the Public DNS or IP for your instance, you can get this from the Instance section of the EC2 Console if you do not already know it. You'll be prompted for the username (nagiosadmin) and password you specified earlier.

e.g. http://ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xx.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/nagios/

Click on the "Service Detail" navbar link to see details of what's being monitored on your local machine. It will take a few minutes for Nagios to check all the services associated with your machine, as the checks are spread out over time.
